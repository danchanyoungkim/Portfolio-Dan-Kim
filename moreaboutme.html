              <p>Currently part of a cohort with upcoming web developers, this project was designed in alignment with my interest and my career aspirations. 
              After attempting a career in education, management, and nursing field in Illinois, I made a difficult decision to turn 180 degrees and start anew, a path I've always wanted to build into, 
              but was too intimidated to start before.

              <p>Growing up all the way from L.A., from Chicago, and now recently resided in New Jersey, each city I cam across was had people interested in basketball. I was not always a fan of watching 
              or playing basketball. I was put into basketball programs in my elementary/middle school years which I loathed. In the end, my interest did spark around high school. 
              Eventually, I started playing basketball a little more seriously than casually in college
