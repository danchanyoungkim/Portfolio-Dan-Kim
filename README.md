Description: With the deployment of html and advanced css techniques, this website provides accessibility across multiple platforms including phones, tablets,
and computers! This website is a portfolio by and about Dan Kim. Although this is currently the product of this current assignment, more changes are to come
as the course continues. 

Significant issue with deploying a live website that took much more than possible. Deleted and re"pushed" from git to github. Finally deployed after multple
attempts, unfortunately, the title name came out to be "Portfolio-final" instead of something more unique; also explains the lack of multiple commits.
*For future reference, it finally deployed after manually installing files and putting the files in right order. Not sure which fixed the bug.
